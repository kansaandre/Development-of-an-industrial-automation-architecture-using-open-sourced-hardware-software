# Development-of-an-industrial-automation-architecture-using-open-sourced-hardware-software
This open-source, community-driven project aims to develop an industrial automation architecture. Open-source vast resources, including source code, forums, libraries and documentation, make it easier to integrate AI tools like ChatGPT, aiding coding, architecture design, troubleshooting and hardware selection. This sets it apart from confidential industrial vendors.

The purpose of sharing this document and data is to establish a general open-source architecture for industrial automation. Version 1.0 serves as an example of how to set up a process control or industrial case using open-source solutions that work together. Moving forward, the goal is to have more people contribute to the project, creating their own versions and iterations with their own cases and examples. Eventually, the hope is to develop a more general system that is easier to implement, while still allowing for customization to fit specific industrial problems. This stands in contrast to many industrial solution vendors that offer little to no customization options.

DETAILED INFO ---> WORD DOCUMENT(S) 

Each version has its own word document, when new version document is made make sure to store the last one in a "legacy" folder inside the respository.
