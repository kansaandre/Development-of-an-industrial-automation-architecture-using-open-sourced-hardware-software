<script type="text/html" data-help-name="serial request">
    <p>Provides a connection to a request/response serial port.</p>
    <p>This node behaves as a tightly coupled combination of <code>serial in</code> and <code>serial out</code> nodes,
       with which it shares the configuration.</p>
    <p>Send the request message in <code>msg.payload</code> as you would do with a <code>serial out</code> node.
       The message will be forwarded to the serial port following a strict FIFO (First In, First Out) queue,
       waiting for a single response before transmitting the next request.
       Once a response is received (with the same logic of a <code>serial in</code> node), or after a timeout occurs,
       a message is sent to the output (see Outputs below),
       with <code>msg.payload</code> containing the received response (or missing in case if timeout) and
       all other properties are preserved.</p>
    <p>For consistency with the <code>serial in</code> node, <code>msg.port</code> is set to the name of the port selected.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>msg.timeout</code> is the timeout (in ms) after which the incoming message is propagated
            to the output with <code>msg.status</code> set to <code>"ERR_TIMEOUT"</code> and missing payload.
            If not present, the default value is 10000 (10s).</li>
        <li><code>msg.count</code> if set this will override the configured number of characters
            as long as it is less than the number configured.</li>
        <li><code>msg.waitfor</code> must be a single character, escape code, or hex code.
            If set, the node will wait until it matches that character in the stream and then start the output.</li>
        <li>Optionally the baudrate can be changed using <code>msg.baudrate</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>msg.payload</code> is the response. If no response occured, this property is removed.</li>
        <li><code>msg.status</code> is <code>"OK"</code> in case a response is received,
            or <code>"ERR_TIMEOUT"</code> if a timeout occurs.</li>
        <li>Any other property coming from the input will be preserved.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The search button should return a list of available serial ports to choose from,

       e.g. in order to power devices via those pins.</p>

    <p>The serial data reception can either
